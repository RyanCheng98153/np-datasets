# DIMACS Graph Coloring Dataset

This repository contains instances from the **DIMACS Graph Coloring Benchmark Dataset**, a standard benchmark suite widely used for evaluating algorithms on the **Graph Coloring Problem (GCP)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview

The dataset was originally introduced as part of the:

> **Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge (1992):**  
> "Cliques, Coloring, and Satisfiability"  
> Organized by the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS), Rutgers University.

Its purpose was to facilitate fair comparison between graph coloring algorithms on a wide range of real-world and synthetic instances.

## ðŸ“‚ Format

All graphs are provided in the **DIMACS `.col` format**, which includes:
- A `p edge` header specifying the number of nodes and edges
- A list of `e u v` entries representing undirected edges between node `u` and node `v`

Example:
```
c Example graph
p edge 5 4
e 1 2
e 2 3
e 3 4
e 4 5
```

## ðŸ§© Use Cases

These instances have been widely used in:
- Benchmarking **graph coloring heuristics and exact solvers**
- Studying **clique and independent set** problems
- Evaluating **SAT/ILP/CSP-based formulations**
