Design a set of delivery routes for a fixed number of vehicles with limited capacity, such that:

1. Each route starts and ends at the depot.
2. Every customer is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle.
3. The total demand served by each vehicle does not exceed its capacity.
4. The sum of the distances (or travel cost) across all routes is minimized.

Objective: Minimize total route cost
Subject to:
  - Each customer visited once
  - Each route starts and ends at depot
  - Total demand on each route â‰¤ vehicle capacity
