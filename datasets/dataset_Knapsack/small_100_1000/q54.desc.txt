Problem: 0/1 Knapsack Optimization from CSV
You are given a list of items in a CSV format. Each item has a value and a weight. Your task is to select a subset of these items to put into a knapsack such that:

The total weight should not be exceeded.

The total value is maximized.

You cannot take fractional items, and you cannot take the same item more than once.

Please note that the total weight is *26718*, maximize the value without exceeding the total weight.
