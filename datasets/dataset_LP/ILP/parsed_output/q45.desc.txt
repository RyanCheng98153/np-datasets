A company sells custom scooters and bikes for customers. The profit per scooter is $200 and the profit per bike is $300. Each product requires time with the design team and engineering team. Each scooter needs 2 hours with the design team and 3 hours with the engineering team. Each bike needs 4 hours with the design team and 5 hours with the engineering team. Per month, there are 5000 hours available on the design team and 6000 hours available on the engineering team. How many of each should the company make per month to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 200*scooters + 300*bikes
