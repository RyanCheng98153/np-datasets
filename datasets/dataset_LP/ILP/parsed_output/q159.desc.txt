A school is organizing a field trip to a science center and wants to hire small buses and large buses. A small bus can carry 20 students while a large bus can carry 50 students.  The school needs to provide transportation for at least 500 students.  In addition, since the parking lot is rather small, a maximum of 20% of the buses can be large buses. How many of each type of bus should be hired to minimize the total number of buses?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*small_buses + 1*large_buses

[ const_type: linear ]
20*small_buses + 50*large_buses >= 500

[ const_type: ratio ]
large_buses <= 0.2 * (large_buses + small_buses)
