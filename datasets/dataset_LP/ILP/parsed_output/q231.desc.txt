A student takes calcium pills and vitamin D pills one after the other. Each calcium pill takes 5 minutes to be effective while each vitamin D pill takes 6 minutes to be effective. Over a month, the student must take at least 130 pills of medication and at least 40 should be vitamin D pills because they enhance the absorption of calcium in the body. Since vitamin D is complimentary to calcium, the student must take more calcium pills than vitamin D pills. How many pills of each should the student take to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, total_time = 5*calcium_pills + 6*vitamin_D_pills

[ const_type: sum ]
calcium_pills + vitamin_D_pills >= 130

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
vitamin_D_pills >= 40

[ const_type: xy ]
calcium_pills > vitamin_D_pills
