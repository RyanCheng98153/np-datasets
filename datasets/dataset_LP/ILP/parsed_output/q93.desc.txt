A toy company can build two factory types, a medium sized factory and a small factory. A medium sized factory can make 50 toys per day and requires 3 operators. A small factory can make 35 toys per day and requires 2 operators. The company must make at least 250 toys per day but they only have available 16 operators. How many of each factory should the company build to minimize the total number of factories?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*medium_sized_factory + 1*small_factory

[ const_type: linear ]
50*medium_sized_factory + 35*small_factory >= 250

[ const_type: linear ]
3*medium_sized_factory + 2*small_factory <= 16
