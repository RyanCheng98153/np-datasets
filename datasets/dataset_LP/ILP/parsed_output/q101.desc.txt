A patient in the hospital can take two pills, Pill 1 and Pill 2. Per pill, pill 1 provides 0.2 units of pain medication and 0.3 units of anxiety medication. Per pill, pill 2 provides 0.6 units of pain medication and 0.2 units of anxiety medication. In addition, pill 1 causes 0.3 units of discharge while pill 2 causes 0.1 units of discharge. At most 6 units of pain medication can be provided and at least 3 units of anxiety medication must be provided. How many pills of each should the patient be given to minimize the total amount of discharge?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, amount_of_discharge = 0.3*Pill_1 + 0.1*Pill_2

[ const_type: linear ]
0.2*Pill_1 + 0.6*Pill_2 <= 6

[ const_type: linear ]
0.3*Pill_1 >= 3
