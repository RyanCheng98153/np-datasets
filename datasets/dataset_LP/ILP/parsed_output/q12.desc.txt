Mrs. Watson wants to invest in the real-estate market and has a total budget of at most $760000. She has two choices which include condos and detached houses. Each dollar invested in condos yields a $0.50 profit and each dollar invested in detached houses yields a $1 profit. A minimum of 20% of all money invested must be in condos, and at least $20000 must be in detached houses. Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment.

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 0.5*condos + 1*detached_houses

[ const_type: sum ]
condos + detached_houses <= 760000

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
detached_houses >= 20000

[ const_type: ratio ]
condos >= 0.2 * (condos + detached_houses)
