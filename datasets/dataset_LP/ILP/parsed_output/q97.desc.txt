A small chocolate shop makes milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars. Milk chocolate bars require 4 units of cocoa and 7 units of milk. Dark chocolate bars require 6 units of cocoa and 3 units of milk. The shop has 2000 units of cocoa and 1750 units of milk available. In addition since milk chocolate sells better, at least 2 times as many milk chocolate bars need to be made as dark chocolate bars.  If making a milk chocolate bar takes 15 minutes and making a dark chocolate bar takes 12 mins, how many of each should the make to minimize total production time?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, total_production_time = 15*milk_chocolate + 12*dark_chocolate_bars

[ const_type: linear ]
4*milk_chocolate + 6*dark_chocolate_bars <= 2000

[ const_type: linear ]
7*milk_chocolate + 3*dark_chocolate_bars <= 1750

[ const_type: xby ]
milk_chocolate >= 2 * dark_chocolate_bars
