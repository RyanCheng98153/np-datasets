A patient in the hospital can take two different pain killers, pain killer 1 and pain killer 2. Per dose, pain killer 1 delivers 0.5 units of medicine to the legs and 0.8 units of medicine to the back. Per dose, pain killer 2 delivers 0.7 units of medicine to the legs and 0.4 units of medicine to the back. In, addition pain killer 1 deliver 0.3 units of sleeping medicine and pain killer 2 delivers 0.6 units of sleeping medicine. At most 8 units of sleep medicine should be delivered and at least 4 units of medicine should be delivered to the legs. How many doses of each should be taken to maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_medicine_delivered_to_the_back = 0.8*pain_killer_1 + 0.4*pain_killer_2

[ const_type: linear ]
0.3*pain_killer_1 + 0.6*pain_killer_2 <= 8

[ const_type: linear ]
0.5*pain_killer_1 + 0.7*pain_killer_2 >= 4
