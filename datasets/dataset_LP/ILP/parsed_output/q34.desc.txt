You are designing an office space with two types of desks: long desks and short desks. You can spend at most $2000. Long desks cost $300, take up 10 square feet of space, and seat 6 employees. Short desks cost $100, take up 4 square feet of space, and seat 2 employees. The office can have at most 200 square feet of desks. How many of each desk should you buy in order to maximize the seating availability?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, seating_availability = 6*long_desks + 2*short_desks

[ const_type: linear ]
300*long_desks + 100*short_desks <= 2000

[ const_type: linear ]
10*long_desks + 4*short_desks <= 200
