A electronics store sells premium desktops with more power as well as regular desktops for everyday use. Each premium desktop costs the store $2000 to make and yields a profit of $500. Each regular desktop costs the store $1000 to make and yields a profit of $300. The store sells at most 200 desktops each month and wants to spend at most $300000 on making the desktops. How many of each should be made and sold to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 500*premium_desktops + 300*regular_desktops

[ const_type: sum ]
premium_desktops + regular_desktops <= 200

[ const_type: linear ]
2000*premium_desktops + 1000*regular_desktops <= 300000
