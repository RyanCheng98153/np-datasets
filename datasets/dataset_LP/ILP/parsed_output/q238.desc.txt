A singer has two types of concerts he can hold, pop and R&B. Each pop concert will bring in 100 audience members and take 2 days of practice. Every R&B concert brings in 240 audience members and takes 4 days of practice. The singer must bring in at least 10000 audience members and only has available 180 days for practice. If he can at most perform 40% of his concerts as R&B because he likes pop songs more, how many of each type of concert should be created to minimize the total number of concerts?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*pop + 1*R&B.

[ const_type: linear ]
100*pop + 240*R&B. >= 10000

[ const_type: linear ]
4*R&B. + 2*pop <= 180

[ const_type: ratio ]
R&B. <= 0.4 * (R&B. + pop)
