A scientist in the arctic needs to get enough vitamin D and vitamin C in his diet by drinking orange and apple juice. Each box of orange juice contains 10 units of vitamin D and 8 units of vitamin C. Each box of apple juice contains 12 units of vitamin D and 6 units of vitamin C. Since the scientist prefers apple juice, he must drink at least 3 times as many apple juice boxes and orange juice boxes. However, he must also drink at least 3 orange juice boxes. To avoid a vitamin C overdose, the scientist can consume at most 300 units of vitamin C. How many of each juice box should he drink to maximize his total vitamin D intake?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, total_vitamin_D = 10*orange + 12*apple_juice

[ const_type: xby ]
apple_juice >= 3 * orange

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
orange >= 3

[ const_type: linear ]
8*orange + 6*apple_juice <= 300
