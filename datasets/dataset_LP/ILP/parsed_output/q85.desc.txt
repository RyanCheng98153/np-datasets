A scientist is conducting two experiments to produce electricity, experiment alpha and experiment beta. In experiment alpha, 3 units of metal and 5 units of acid are required to produce 8 units of electricity. In experiment beta, 5 units of metal and 4 units of acid are required to produced 10 units of electricity. The lab has 800 units of metal and 750 units of acid available. How many of each experiment should the scientist conduct to maximize the total amount of electricity produced?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_electricity = 8*experiment_alpha + 10*experiment_beta

[ const_type: linear ]
3*experiment_alpha + 5*experiment_beta <= 800

[ const_type: linear ]
5*experiment_alpha + 4*experiment_beta <= 750
