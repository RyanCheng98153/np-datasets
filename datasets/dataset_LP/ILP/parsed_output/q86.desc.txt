A man fishes in a 250 acre lake and can catch fish either using a net or fishing line. For each acre of the lake, using a net will catch 8 fish and requires 4 units of bait but also causes 2 units of pain for the fisherman. For each acre of the lake, using a fishing line will catch 5 fish and requires 3 units of bait but also causes 1 unit of pain for the fisherman. The fisherman has available 800 units of bait and can tolerate at most 350 units of pain. For how many acres each should he use each fishing method to maximize the amount of fish he can catch?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_fish = 8*net + 5*fishing_line

[ const_type: sum ]
net + fishing_line <= 250

[ const_type: linear ]
4*net + 3*fishing_line <= 800

[ const_type: linear ]
2*net + 1*fishing_line <= 350
