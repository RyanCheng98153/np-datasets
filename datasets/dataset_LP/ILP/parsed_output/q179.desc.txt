A village hosts a banquet and provides bike and car transportation for everyone. A bike can take 3 people while a car can take 5 people. Since cars are more expensive, at most 40% of the vehicles can be cars. If the village needs to transport at least 500 people, how many of each vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of bikes needed?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*bike

[ const_type: ratio ]
car <= 0.4 * (car + bike)

[ const_type: linear ]
3*bike + 5*car >= 500
