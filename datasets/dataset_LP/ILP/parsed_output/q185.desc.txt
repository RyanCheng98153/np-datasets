A factory transports rice to the city in horse-drawn carts that are either medium or large size. A medium sized cart requires 2 horses and can carry 30 kg of rice. A large sized cart requires 4 horses and can carry 70 kg of rice.  The factory has 60 horses available. Because the horses don't get along well, the number of medium sized carts must be three times the number of large sized carts. In addition, there must be at least 5 medium sized carts and at least 5 large sized carts. How many of each cart size should be used to maximize the amount of rice that can be transported?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_rice = 30*medium + 70*large

[ const_type: linear ]
2*medium + 4*large <= 60

[ const_type: xby ]
medium >= 3 * large

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
medium >= 5

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
large >= 5
