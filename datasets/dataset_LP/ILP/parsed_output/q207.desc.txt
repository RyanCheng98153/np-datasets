A toy store sells plush toys and dolls. Each plush toy costs the store $3 and each doll costs the store $2. The store owner can spend at most $700 on inventory. Each plush toy is then sold for a profit of $4 while each doll is sold for a profit of $2. The owner estimates that at least 90 plush toys but at most 190 plush toys are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of dolls sold is at most twice the amount of plush toys sold. How many of each should be bought and sold to maximize profit?

MAXIMIZE, profit = 4*plush_toys + 2*dolls

[ const_type: linear ]
3*plush_toys + 2*dolls <= 700

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
plush_toys >= 90

[ const_type: upperbound ]
plush_toys <= 190

[ const_type: xby ]
dolls <= 2 * plush_toys
