A woman has $100000 to gamble on two sports bets: a basketball tournament, a horse race, and a soccer game. Based on simple analysis, the woman determines her chance of losing her money would be 50% for basketball tournament, 25% for horse race, and 10% for the soccer game. The payout for each dollar put on each bet will be $1.2 for basketball tournament, $0.5 for horse race, and $0.1 for the soccer game. Knowing herself, she limits her average chance of losing her money should be at most 30%. Could you help her determine how much to money to put on each sport bet to maximize her average payout?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, payout = 1.2*basketball_tournament + 0.5*horse_race + 0.1*soccer_game

[ const_type: sum ]
basketball_tournament + horse_race + soccer_game <= 100000

[ const_type: linear ]
0.5*basketball_tournament + 0.25*horse_race + 0.1*soccer_game <= 0.3
