A toy store hires seasonal and full-time volunteers to deliver gifts and gives them points for service. A seasonal volunteer can deliver 5 gifts and gets 2 points. A full-time volunteer can deliver 8 gifts and gets 5 points. The store can only give out 200 points. In addition, a maximum of 30% of the volunteers can be seasonal and at least 10 must be full-time. How many of each volunteer is needed to maximize the total number of gifts that can be delivered?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, number_of_gifts = 5*seasonal + 8*full-time

[ const_type: linear ]
2*seasonal + 5*full-time <= 200

[ const_type: ratio ]
seasonal <= 0.3 * (seasonal + full-time)

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
full-time >= 10
