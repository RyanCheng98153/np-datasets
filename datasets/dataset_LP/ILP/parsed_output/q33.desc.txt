The profit per regular model is $5000 and the profit per premium model is $8500 (x1 and x2 are unknown values both greater than or equal to 0). The daily demand for these cars is limited to and most 8 regular models and 6 premium models. In addition, the manufacturer can make a maximum of 12 cars of either type per day. How many cars of each model should the manufacturer make in order to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 8500*premium_model + 5000*regular_model

[ const_type: upperbound ]
regular_model <= 8

[ const_type: upperbound ]
premium_model <= 6

[ const_type: sum ]
regular_model + premium_model <= 12
