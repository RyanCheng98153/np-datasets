A company is deciding where to promote their product. Some options include z-tube, soorchle engine, and wassa advertisements. The cost for each option and the number of viewers they each attract is given. On z-tube, each ad costs $1000 and attracts 400,000 viewers. On soorchle, each ad costs $200 and attracts 5,000 viewers. On wassa, each ad costs $100 and attracts 3,000 viewers. Soorchle limits the number of advertisements from a single company to fifteen. Moreover, in order to balance the advertising among the three types of media, at most a third of the total number of advertisements should occur on wassa. And at least 5% should occur on z-tube. The weekly advertising budget is $10000. How many advertisements should be run in each of the three types of media to maximize the total audience?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, audience = 400000*z-tube + 5000*soorchle + 3000*wassa

[ const_type: upperbound ]
soorchle <= 15

[ const_type: ratio ]
wassa <= 0.333 * (wassa + z-tube + soorchle)

[ const_type: ratio ]
z-tube >= 0.05 * (z-tube + soorchle + wassa)

[ const_type: linear ]
1000*z-tube + 200*soorchle + 100*wassa <= 10000
