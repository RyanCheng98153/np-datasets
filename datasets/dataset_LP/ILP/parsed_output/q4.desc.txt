Ben is growing apples and pears on his orchard. He has 50 acres available on which he must grow a minimum of 5 acres of apples and a minimum of 10 acres of pears to meet demands. The profit per apple is $2 and the profit per pear is $4. He prefers to grow more pears than apples but limitations in his workforce allow him to grow at most twice the amount of pears as apples. How many of each fruit should Ben grow in order to maximize his profit? What is that profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 2*apples + 4*pears

[ const_type: sum ]
apples + pears <= 50

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
apples >= 5

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
pears >= 10

[ const_type: xby ]
pears <= 2 * apples
