A lighting company makes desk-lamps and night-lamps. There is an expected demand of at least 30 desk-lamps and 50 night-lamps each day. However, due to the size of their factory, they can make at most 150 desk-lamps and 180 night-lamps per day. To satisfy a contract, a minimum of 100 lamps must be made each day. If the profit per desk-lamp sold is $5 and the profit per night-lamp sold is $8, how many lamps of each type should be made to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 8*night-lamps + 5*desk-lamps

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
desk-lamps >= 30

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
night-lamps >= 50

[ const_type: upperbound ]
desk-lamps <= 150

[ const_type: upperbound ]
night-lamps <= 180

[ const_type: sum ]
desk-lamps + night-lamps >= 100
