My family has decided to invest in real state for the first time. Currently, they have $600,000 to invest, some in apartments and the rest in townhouses. The money invested in apartments must not be greater than $200,000. They have decided that the money invested in apartments must be at least a half as much as that in townhouses.  If the apartments earn 10%, and the townhouses earn 15%, how much money should they invest in each to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 0.15*townhouses + 0.1*apartments

[ const_type: sum ]
apartments + townhouses <= 600000

[ const_type: upperbound ]
apartments <= 200000

[ const_type: xby ]
apartments >= 0.5 * townhouses
