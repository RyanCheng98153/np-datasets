There are two processes, process A and process B, to plate a coin with gold. Process A requires 3 units of gold, 2 wires, and can plate 5 coins. Process B requires 5 units of gold, 3 wires, and can plate 7 coins. There are 500 units of gold and 300 wires available. How many processes of each type should be run to maximize the total number of coins that can be plated?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, number_of_coins = 5*process_A + 7*process_B

[ const_type: linear ]
3*process_A + 5*process_B <= 500

[ const_type: linear ]
2*process_A + 3*process_B <= 300
