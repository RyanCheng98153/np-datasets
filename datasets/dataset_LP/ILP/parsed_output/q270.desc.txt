A village delivers mail to nearby villages either by runners or canoers. Runners can carry three bags of mail each time and takes 4 hours. Canoers can carry ten bags of mail each time and takes 2 hours. At most 33% of deliveries can be by canoe. Additionally, the village can spare at most 200 total hours and at least 4 runners must be used. How many of each way to deliver must be used to maximize the total amount of mail that can be delivered?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_mail = 10*canoers + 3*runners

[ const_type: linear ]
4*runners + 2*canoers <= 200

[ const_type: ratio ]
canoers <= 0.33 * (canoers + runners)

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
runners >= 4
