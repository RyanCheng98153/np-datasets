A municipality hires full-time and part-time staff to deliver mail. Part-time staff works 15 hours per week and gets paid 450 dollars whereas a full-time staff works 40 hours every week and gets paid 1280 dollars  for that week.  Since it is the week leading up to a holiday, planning ahead, the municipality needs 1000 hours of mail staff labor. The municipality has a budget of 31500 dollars for mail delivery for this season. How many of each type of staff should the municipality hire to decrease the total number of staff?

MINIMIZE, 1*full-time_and + 1*part-time_staff

[ const_type: linear ]
40*full-time_and + 15*part-time_staff >= 1000

[ const_type: linear ]
450*part-time_staff + 1280*full-time_and <= 31500
