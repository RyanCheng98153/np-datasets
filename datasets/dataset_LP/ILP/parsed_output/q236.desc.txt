A dentist has 3000 units of resin to fill cavities in both molars and canines. Molars require 20 units of resin and 3 units of pain killer. Canines require 15 units of resin and 2.3 units of pain killer. Since this dentist sees more cavities in canines, at least 60% of cavities filled must be in canines. In addition, the dentist must reserve materials to fill at least 45 molars. How many of each type of teeth should the dentist schedule to fill to minimize the amount of pain killer needed?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, amount_of_pain_killer = 2.3*canines + 3*molars

[ const_type: linear ]
20*molars + 15*canines <= 3000

[ const_type: ratio ]
canines >= 0.6 * (canines + molars)

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
molars >= 45
