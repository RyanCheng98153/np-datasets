A farmer wants to mix his animal feeds, Feed A and Feed B, in such a way that the mixture will contain a minimum of 30 units of protein and 50 units of fat. Feed A costs $100 per kilogram and contains 10 units of protein and 8 units of fat. Feed B costs $80 per kilogram and contains 7 units of protein and 15 units of fat. Determine the minimum cost of the mixture.

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, cost = 100*Feed_A + 80*Feed_B

[ const_type: linear ]
10*Feed_A + 7*Feed_B >= 30

[ const_type: linear ]
8*Feed_A + 15*Feed_B >= 50
