A patient can be hooked up to two machines to have medicine delivered, machine 1 and machine 2. Machine 1 delivers 0.5 units of medicine to the heart per minute and 0.8 units of medicine per minute to the brain. Machine 2 delivers 0.3 units of medicine per minute to the heart and 1 unit of medicine per minute to the brain. In addition however, machine 1 creates 0.3 units of waste per minute while machine 2 creates 0.5 units of waste per minute. If at most 8 units of medicine can be received by the heart and at least 4 units of medicine should be received by the brain, how many minutes should each machine be used to minimize the total amount of waste produced?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, total_amount_of_waste = 0.3*machine_1 + 0.5*machine_2

[ const_type: linear ]
0.5*machine_1 + 0.3*machine_2 <= 8

[ const_type: linear ]
0.8*machine_1 + 1*machine_2 >= 4
