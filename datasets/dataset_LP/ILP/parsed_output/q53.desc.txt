A sandwich company can open two types of stores, a dine-in place and a food-truck. A dine-in place can make 100 sandwiches per day and requires 8 employees to operate. A food-truck can make 50 sandwiches per day and requires 3 employees to operate. The company must make at least 500 sandwiches per day but they only have available 35 employees. How many of each type of store should the company open to minimize the total number of stores?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*dine-in_place + 1*food-truck

[ const_type: linear ]
100*dine-in_place + 50*food-truck >= 500

[ const_type: linear ]
8*dine-in_place + 3*food-truck <= 35
