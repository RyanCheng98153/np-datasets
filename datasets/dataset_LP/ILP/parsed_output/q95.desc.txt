There are two chemical reactions, chemical reaction A and chemical reaction B. Chemical reaction A requires 5 units of rare inert gas and 6 units of treated water to produce 10 units of a rare compound. Chemical reaction B requires 7 units of rare inert gas and 3 units of treater water to produce 8 units of a rare compound. There are 1000 units of the rare inert gas and 800 units of treated water available in the lab. How many reactions of each type should be done to maximize the amount of rare compound produced?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_rare_compound = 10*chemical_reaction_A + 8*chemical_reaction_B.

[ const_type: linear ]
5*chemical_reaction_A + 7*chemical_reaction_B. <= 1000

[ const_type: linear ]
6*chemical_reaction_A + 3*chemical_reaction_B. <= 800
