A pharmacy makes eye cream and foot cream using two different machines, machine 1 and machine 2. Machine 1 can  make 30 ml of eye cream and 60 ml of foot cream per hour. Machine 2 can make 45 ml of eye cream and 30 ml of foot cream per hour. Furthermore, machine 1 requires 20 ml of distilled water per hour while machine 2 requires 15 ml of distilled water per hour. The pharmacy has available 1200 ml of distilled water. If the pharmacy needs to make at least 1300 ml of eye cream and 1500 ml of foot cream, how many hours should each machine be used to minimize the total time needed?
