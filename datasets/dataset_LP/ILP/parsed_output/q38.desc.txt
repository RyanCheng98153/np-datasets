A food truck owner can spend at most $20000 on mangos and guavas. A mango costs the food truck owner $5 and a guava costs him $3. Spices are added and each mango is sold for a profit of $3 while each guava is sold for a profit of $4. The owner estimates that at least 100 mangos but at the most 150 are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of guavas sold is at most a third of the mangos sold. How many mangos and guavas should be sold in order to maximize the profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 3*mangos + 4*guavas

[ const_type: linear ]
5*mangos + 3*guavas <= 20000

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
mangos >= 100

[ const_type: upperbound ]
mangos <= 150

[ const_type: xby ]
guavas <= 0.333 * mangos
