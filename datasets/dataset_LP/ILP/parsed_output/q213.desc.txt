A man takes two supplements to get his daily iron and calcium requirements. A pill of supplement A has 5 units of iron and 10 units of calcium. A pill of supplement B contains 4 units of iron and 15 units of calcium.  The man needs a minimum of 40 units of iron and 50 units of calcium per day. If the cost per pill of supplement A is $2 and the cost per pill of supplement B is  $3, how many of each should he buy to minimize costs?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, costs = 3*supplement_B + 2*supplement_A

[ const_type: linear ]
5*supplement_A + 4*supplement_B >= 40

[ const_type: linear ]
10*supplement_A + 15*supplement_B >= 50
