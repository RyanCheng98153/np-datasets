A doctor recommends that a man eat burgers and pizza in order to put on weight. Each burger contains 10 units of fat and 300 calories. Each slice of pizza contains 8 units of fat and 250 calories. The man must get at least 130 units of fat and 3000 calories. Further, each burger contains 12 units of cholesterol while each slice of pizza contains 10 units of cholesterol. Since burgers are slightly more expensive, the man decides to eat at least twice as many slices of pizza as burgers. How many of each should he eat to minimize his cholesterol intake?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, cholesterol_intake = 12*burgers + 10*pizza

[ const_type: linear ]
10*burgers + 8*pizza >= 130

[ const_type: linear ]
300*burgers + 250*pizza >= 3000

[ const_type: xby ]
pizza >= 2 * burgers
