A food company would like to run its commercials on three streaming platforms: Pi TV, Beta Video and Gamma Live. The cost for a commercial as well as the expected audience reach is given. On Pi TV, a commercial costs $1200 and attracts 2000 viewers. On Beta Video, a commercial costs $2000 and attracts 5000 viewers. On Gamma Live, a commercial costs $4000 and attracts 9000 viewers. Beta Video limits the number of commercials from a single company to 8. In order to attract a wide range of people, at most a third of all commercials should occur on Gamma Live and a minimum of 20% should occur on Pi TV. If the weekly budget is $20000, how many commercials should be run in each of the three possible choices in order to maximize audience?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, audience = 2000*Pi_TV + 5000*Beta_Video + 9000*Gamma_Live

[ const_type: upperbound ]
Beta_Video <= 8

[ const_type: ratio ]
Gamma_Live <= 0.333 * (Gamma_Live + Pi_TV + Beta_Video)

[ const_type: ratio ]
Pi_TV >= 0.2 * (Pi_TV + Beta_Video + Gamma_Live)

[ const_type: linear ]
1200*Pi_TV + 2000*Beta_Video + 4000*Gamma_Live <= 20000
