A lab has 1000 units of medicinal ingredients to make two pills, a large pill and a small pill. A large pill requires 3 units of medicinal ingredients and 2 units of filler. A small pill requires 2 units of medicinal ingredients and 1 unit of filler. The lab has to make at least 100 large pills. However, since small pills are more popular at least 60% of the total number of pills must be small. How many of each should be made to minimize the total number of filler material needed?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, number_of_filler = 2*large_pill + 1*small_pill

[ const_type: linear ]
3*large_pill + 2*small_pill <= 1000

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
large_pill >= 100

[ const_type: ratio ]
small_pill >= 0.6 * (small_pill + large_pill)
