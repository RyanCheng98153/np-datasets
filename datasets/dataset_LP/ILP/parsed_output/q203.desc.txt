An office company makes desks and drawers. Each desk requires 40 minutes of assembly and 20 minutes of sanding. Each drawer requires 30 minutes of assembly and 10 minutes of sanding. The company has available 4000 minutes for assembly and 3500 minutes for sanding. If the profit per desk is $100 and the profit per drawer is $90, how many of each should the company make to maximize profit?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, profit = 100*desks + 90*drawers

[ const_type: linear ]
40*desks + 30*drawers <= 4000

[ const_type: linear ]
20*desks + 10*drawers <= 3500
