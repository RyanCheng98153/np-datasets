A summer camps does science experiments in two pre filled beakers, beaker 1 and beaker 2. Beaker 1 uses 4 units of flour and 6 units of special liquid to make 5 units of slime. Beaker 2 uses 6 units of flour and 3 units of special liquid to make 3 units of slime.  However, beaker 1 creates 4 units of waste while beaker 2 creates 2 units of waste. The summer camp has available 150 units of flour and 100 units of special liquid. If at most 30 units of waste can be produced, how many of each beaker should be used to maximize the amount of slime produced?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_slime = 5*beaker_1 + 3*beaker_2

[ const_type: linear ]
4*beaker_1 + 6*beaker_2 <= 150

[ const_type: linear ]
6*beaker_1 + 3*beaker_2 <= 100

[ const_type: linear ]
4*beaker_1 + 2*beaker_2 <= 30
