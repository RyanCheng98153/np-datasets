A pharmaceutical company has 800 units of painkiller medicine and makes daytime and nighttime painkiller. A daytime pill has 6 units of painkiller medicine and 2 units of sleep medicine. A nighttime pill has 5 units of painkiller medicine and 5 units of sleep medicine. Since some people donâ€™t want the sleeping effect, at least 40% of the pills must be daytime pills. However at least 200 nighttime pills must be made. How many of each pill should be made to minimize the total amount of sleep medicine required?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, amount_of_sleep_medicine = 2*daytime + 5*nighttime_painkiller

[ const_type: linear ]
6*daytime + 5*nighttime_painkiller <= 800

[ const_type: ratio ]
daytime >= 0.4 * (daytime + nighttime_painkiller)

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
nighttime_painkiller >= 200
