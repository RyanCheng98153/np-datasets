Maple Oil processes three types of crude oil: light oil, non-sticky oil and heavy oil. Each tank of light oil produces a net revenue of $550, each tank of non-sticky oil produces a net revenue of $750, and each tank of heavy oil produces a net revenue of $950. To process a tank of light oil, 3 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of non-sticky oil, 6 units of compound A and 2 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of heavy oil, 9 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. Currently the company has 250 units of compound A and 150 units of compound B to process. How many full or partial tanks of each oil should the company process so that net revenue is maximized?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, net_revenue = 550*light_oil + 750*non-sticky_oil + 950*heavy_oil

[ const_type: linear ]
3*light_oil + 6*non-sticky_oil + 9*heavy_oil <= 250

[ const_type: linear ]
3*heavy_oil + 2*non-sticky_oil + 3*light_oil <= 150
