A neighbourhood pizza restaurant has opened and sells pizzas in two sizes; large pizza and medium pizza. Large pizzas require 12 units of dough, and 5 units of toppings. Medium pizzas require 8 units of dough, and 4 units of toppings. While large pizzas take 12 minutes to bake, medium pizzas require 8 minutes to bake. The neighbourhood pizza restaurant must use at least 10000 units of dough and 4400 units of toppings. Medium pizzas are popular due to a promotion, therefore, at least 200 medium pizzas must be made. There are regulars that prefer large pizzas and at least two times as many large pizzas should be made than medium pizzas. How many of each size of pizzas should the neighbourhood pizza restaurant make to reduce time spent baking?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, time_spent_baking = 8*medium_pizza + 12*large_pizza

[ const_type: linear ]
12*large_pizza + 8*medium_pizza >= 10000

[ const_type: linear ]
5*large_pizza + 4*medium_pizza >= 4400

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
medium_pizza >= 200

[ const_type: xby ]
large_pizza >= 2 * medium_pizza
