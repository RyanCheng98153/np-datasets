My grandma is required to take two medicines Z1 and D3 everyday. She needs to take at least 5 grams of Z1 and 10 grams of D3 everyday. These medicines are available in two pills named Zodiac and Sunny. One pill of Zodiac contains 1.3 grams of Z1 while one pill of Sunny contains 1.2 grams of Z1. On the other hand, one pill of Zodiac contains 1.5 grams of D3 and one pill of Sunny contains 5 grams of D3. The cost per pill of Zodiac is $1 and the cost per pill of Sunny is $3. Formulate a LP such that the medicine requirement can be fulfilled at the lowest cost.
