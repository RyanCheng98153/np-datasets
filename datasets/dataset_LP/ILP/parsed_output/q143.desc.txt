A chemistry teacher teaches her students two experiments, experiment 1 and experiment 2. In experiment 1, 3 units of the red liquid and 4 units of the blue liquid mix to create 5 units of green gas. In experiment 2, 5 units of the red liquid and 3 units of the blue liquid mix to create 6 units of the green gas. In addition, experiment 1 produces 1 units of smelly gas while experiment 2 produces 2 units of smelly gas.  The lab has available 80 units of red liquid and 70 units of blue liquid. If at most 10 units of smelly gas can be produced, how many experiments of each should be done to maximize the total amount of green gas produced?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MAXIMIZE, amount_of_green_gas = 5*experiment_1 + 6*experiment_2

[ const_type: linear ]
3*experiment_1 + 5*experiment_2 <= 80

[ const_type: linear ]
4*experiment_1 + 3*experiment_2 <= 70

[ const_type: linear ]
1*experiment_1 + 2*experiment_2 <= 10
