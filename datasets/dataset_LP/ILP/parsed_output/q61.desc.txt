A city employs seasonal and permanent snow removers. A seasonal snow remover works 6 hours per shift and gets paid $120. A permanent snow remover works 10 hours per shift and gets paid $250. Currently the city needs 300 hours of snow remover labor after a heavy snowfall. If the city has a budget of $6500, how many of each type of worker should be hired to minimize the total number of snow removers?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*seasonal + 1*permanent

[ const_type: linear ]
6*seasonal + 10*permanent >= 300

[ const_type: linear ]
120*seasonal + 250*permanent <= 6500
