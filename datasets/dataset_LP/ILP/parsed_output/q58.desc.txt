An amusement park is installing ticket machines, both cash-based and card-only machines. A cash-based machine can process 20 people per hour while a card-only machine can process 30 people per hour. The cash-based machine needs 4 rolls of paper per hour while the card-only machine requires 5 rolls of paper per hour. The amusement park needs to be able to process at least 500 people per hour but can use at most 90 rolls of paper per hour. Since most people prefer to pay by cash, the number of card-only machines must not exceed the number of cash-based machines. How many of each machine should be bought to minimize the total number of machines in the park?

[ Objective Declaration ]
MINIMIZE, 1*cash-based + 1*card-only

[ const_type: linear ]
20*cash-based + 30*card-only >= 500

[ const_type: linear ]
4*cash-based + 5*card-only <= 90

[ const_type: xy ]
card-only <= cash-based
