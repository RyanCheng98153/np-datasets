A disease testing station is conducting a temperature check and/or a blood test on each patient. A temperature check takes 2 minutes while a blood test takes 10 minutes. The disease testing station must conduct at least 45 blood tests. Since the temperature check is recommended to be performed on most people, the testing station requires that the temperature check is performed at least 5 times as many as the blood test. If the disease testing station only has a total of 22000 staff minutes, how many of each test or check should be done to maximize the number of patients seen?

MAXIMIZE, 1*temperature_check + 1*blood_test

[ const_type: linear ]
2*temperature_check + 10*blood_test <= 22000

[ const_type: lowerbound ]
blood_test >= 45

[ const_type: xby ]
temperature_check >= 5 * blood_test
