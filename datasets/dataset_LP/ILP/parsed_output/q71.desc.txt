A clinic employs nurses and pharmacists to deliver shots to patients. A nurse works 5 hours per shift while a pharmacist works 7 hours per shift. Nurses are paid $250 per shift while pharmacists are paid $300 per shift. Currently, the clinic needs 200 hours of healthcare labor to meet needs. If the firm has a budget of $9000, how many of each healthcare worker should be scheduled to minimize the total number of workers?
